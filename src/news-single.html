                    The spirit of community and celebration was palpable on August 13 as the NECC Special Olympics Track and Field event took place at
                    Marlborough High School. This marked a significant return to local competition after a hiatus, bringing back the excitement and camaraderie
                    that defines the Special Olympics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For many years, NECC students traveled to Harvard University in Boston for the Special Olympics of Massachusetts (SOMA) track and field
                    event, but the challenges of long travel and the logistical complexities of larger state-sanctioned events prompted a change in 2019 when a
                    NECC-only event was first brought to Marlborough. The local setting, just 15 minutes from NECC Southborough, proved to be a game-changer,
                    making it easier to tailor the event to their needs and, in turn, allowing more students to participate.

                  <p>
                    “Our relationship with the Special Olympics has been great,” said Lauren Kot, APE teacher at NECC. “They’ve really let us adapt to what we
                    need to be successful. By minimizing travel time and wait times, it allows our students to get outside and to be active and engaged for the
                    full hour they are here. This smaller, more intimate event helps them leave with a positive experience.”

                  <p>
                    After being sidelined due to COVID-19 and staffing challenges for the last few years, the event’s return was met with joy and enthusiasm
                    this year. Students participated in a range of activities, including a 50-yard dash, “javelin” throw, softball toss, and long jump. A medal
                    ceremony filled with high fives and smiles capped off the day.

                  <p>
                    “There is so much joy and enthusiasm that comes when you get to experience a Special Olympics sporting event,” added Kot. “For our students,
                    it creates an opportunity to come together as a school community and participate alongside one another. For some, this may be in
                    competition; for others, it may be in individual skill practice. Both of which help to build and foster an appreciation for physical
                    activity and sport, along with the enjoyment of being part of a community.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the highlights of the event was seeing the students so excited and active. “It feels great when we can offer an experience outside of
                    school that our students can take part in. We see a lot of heightened engagement from getting to be outside in a different setting. It
                    brings the energy and excitement to a new level,” said Kot.

                    Throughout the year, NECC students also have an opportunity to participate in Special Olympics Soccer in the fall and Special Olympics
                    Basketball in the winter.
