                          Autism is a developmental disability that causes social and communication challenges and may occur with significant behavioral
                          challenges as well. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 1 in 36 children has autism and more than 3.5 million Americans live
                          with autism. These numbers translate into huge costs: autism services in the U.S. are $249 billion per year, more than any other
                          medical condition - greater than cancer, heart disease and stroke combined.

                          Genetic inheritance is involved in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Genetic factors likely interact with
                          environmental variables to result in the expression of autism.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Neurobiological research indicates that autism is likely the result of genetically determined abnormalities in brain development. This
                          abnormal brain development may start before the child is born.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          It has been difficult for genetics researchers to locate a specific chromosome(s) involved in autism, but recent studies have
                          identified several genetic mechanisms that each lead to autism.

                          The original estimates of the prevalence of autism indicated that it occurred in around 2 per 10,000 people. However, recent estimates
                          place the prevalence as high as or higher than 1 in 36 children for all autism spectrum disorders combined according to the Centers
                          for Disease Control (CDC).

                        <p>
                          It is likely that the increased prevalence of autism is due to increased awareness of the disorder by the population at large as well
                          as by physicians and other providers of service to children and better diagnostic tools that more accurately covers the entire autism
                          spectrum. There is some evidence that suggests that mental retardation is being given as a primary diagnosis less often than in the
                          past. The increased prevalence of autism coincides with this decrease. However, a true increase in the prevalence of autism across
                          time is certainly possible.

                          Autism is a developmental disability that causes social and communication challenges and may occur with significant behavioral
                          challenges as well. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 1 in 36 children has autism and more than 3.5 million Americans live
                          with autism. These numbers translate into huge costs: autism services in the U.S. are $249 billion per year, more than any other
                          medical condition - greater than cancer, heart disease and stroke combined.

                          Genetic inheritance is involved in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Genetic factors likely interact with
                          environmental variables to result in the expression of autism.

                          Neurobiological research indicates that autism is likely the result of genetically determined abnormalities in brain development. This
                          abnormal brain development may start before the child is born.

                          It has been difficult for genetics researchers to locate a specific chromosome(s) involved in autism, but recent studies have
                          identified several genetic mechanisms that each lead to autism.

                          place the prevalence as high as or higher than 1 in 36 children for all autism spectrum disorders combined according to the Centers

                          It is likely that the increased prevalence of autism is due to increased awareness of the disorder by the population at large as well

                          The original estimates of the prevalence of autism indicated that it occurred in around 2 per 10,000 people. However, recent estimates
                          place the prevalence as high as or higher than 1 in 36 children for all autism spectrum disorders combined according to the Centers
                          for Disease Control (CDC).

                          It is likely that the increased prevalence of autism is due to increased awareness of the disorder by the population at large as well
                          as by physicians and other providers of service to children and better diagnostic tools that more accurately covers the entire autism
                          spectrum. There is some evidence that suggests that mental retardation is being given as a primary diagnosis less often than in the
                          past. The increased prevalence of autism coincides with this decrease. However, a true increase in the prevalence of autism across
                          time is certainly possible.
